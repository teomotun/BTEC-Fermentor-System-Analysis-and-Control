# BTEC-Fermentor-System-Analysis-and-Control

## Overview

The project involves extending the analysis of the data generated by the fermentors in the NC State University BTEC intermediate upstream suite to a non-linear model and using deadtime. The deliverables will are in the Matlab code and the repoer file.

* Simulated (in Matlab) the open loop system, and provided a graph of how the dissolved oxygen changes over time. I also discussed the result in the report file.

* Designed (in Matlab) a PI feedback control system with the goal to maintain the dissolved oxygen content in the fermentor at 50% of the air-based oxygen saturation concentration. To do this, I used ode23 to simulate the system. I also used a set of “good” controller parameters that do not make the system unstable.
